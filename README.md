# Kettle Companion Basic MacOS Menubar Application

A basic menubar app for the wonderfully useful and low maintenance [Kettle Companion](https://kettlecompanion.com) by [Andy SC](https://twitter.com/andysc)

This is my first Swift application so it is likely to be a bit buggy, open source as always please do with as you wish.  To get this working you will need a Kettle Companion and to talk to Andy regarding getting MQTT details. There are no guarantees this will work or not burn down your house or send you angry letters in the post.
