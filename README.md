# Kettle Companion Basic MacOS Menubar Application

A basic menubar app for the wonderfully useful and low maintenance [Kettle Companion](https://kettlecompanion.com) by [Andy SC](https://twitter.com/andysc)

This is my first Swift application so it is likely to be a bit buggy, open source as always please do with as you wish.  To get this working you will need a Kettle Companion and to talk to Andy regarding getting MQTT details. There are no guarantees this will work or not burn down your house or send you angry letters in the post.

You will need to compile this yourself and run locally, I don't have a Apple Developer Licence and don't plan to get one soon.  Also you will need the [Kettle-Companion-Pods](https://github.com/ghostseven/Kettle-Companion-Pods) repo as well to setup the pods for MQTT.

I can help with things if you get stuck but I am no expert in Swift. Good god man I write .NET code for my crimes.
